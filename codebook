#CodeBook
Descirption of the data, variables and work performed to create the tidy data set.

##Assumptions

Raw data is located in the working directory in the folder UCI HAR Dataset/

##Variables

merged_data <- dataMerge("UCI HAR Dataset")
extracted_mean_std_data_set <- extractMeanStd(merged_data, "UCI HAR Dataset")
rewriteTidyData_set(extracted_mean_std_data_set, "./tidyset.txt")

This code uses the functions defined in the script and the raw data to create the tidy data set.

##dataMerge

Data for dataMerge is read in from:
- test/X_test.txt
- train/X_train.txt
- activities.txt
- train/subject_train.txt
- test/subject_test.txt
- train/y_train.txt
- test/y_test.txt

dataMerge also provides for some rearrangement of labels

- y_train_labels = a merged data table of the activity labels
- y_test_labels = a merged data table of the label data based on the activity labels
- train_data = merged training data with subject, activity, etc.
- test_data = merged test data table with subject, activity, etc.
- all_data = train_data and test_data merged

##extractMeanStd

extractMeanStd uses data from:

- features.txt lists all the 541 features and their names

Transformations inside extractMeanStd

- mean_std_rows = subset of extracted mean() and std() columns
- insert 3 colnames() to the data set for subject activity and activity id
- mean_columns is the mean column subset
- std_columns is the std column subset
- mean_std_column_vector is the sorted vector containing mean_columns and std_columns
- extracted_data_set is the final data table

##rewriteTidyData_set

All local variables inside this function are all derived after transformations

Transformations inside rewriteTidayData_set

- tidy_data is the data post dcast so that we can list mean for activities
- col_names_vector is a vector containing formatted column headers
- tidy_data is the final data table with column headers
